# First Lesson to develop a TelegramBot with Java
This repository is the start point for Creating a Telegram Bot with Java .it will echo back what the bot user send,it means when a user for example writes "Hello" then the bot will answer "Hello".
If you are a little familiar with java then can use it easily.of course you need to get a telegram token and I hope you know how to do it.
you need just to paste your telegram token to Main file.
I used Apache Netbeans IDE 24 / Java 17 installed on my laptop / windows 10
other information about telegram version and dependency can be found on pom.xml file,if you like to check !
Note : this telegram bot will work when your pc is running and connected to the internet but in future you need to buy and use a host to install your bot.
